## Versions
- **v1-Core** (better for understanding code): This folder contains the simplest implementation of the quiz game, focusing on core C++ concepts without any advanced features. It serves as a foundational version for understanding the basic structure and functionality of a quiz game.

- **v2-UI**: This version enhances the command-line interface (CLI) of the quiz game, improving user interaction through better colors and spacing. While it retains a straightforward question loading mechanism, it provides a more engaging text-based experience.

- **v2.1-UI** (better for actually using it as a quiz test): This version builds upon `v2-UI` by adding functionality to load questions from a `.csv` file. This feature allows for dynamic question management, making it easier to update and expand the quiz content.

**Summary:** The Quiz Game C++ CLI project consists of three distinct versions, each building upon the previous one. `v1-Core` provides a basic understanding of C++ concepts, while `v2-UI` enhances the CLI with better colors and spacing for improved user interaction. `v2.1-UI` further enhances this by enabling dynamic question loading from a `.csv` file, allowing for greater flexibility in managing quiz content.


# Cpp Version Requirement

While **99.99%** of the code works with **C++11**, one function requires **C++17** for directory creation using the **`<filesystem>`** library. If using **C++11**, remove the folder creation code and manually create a **`UserHistoryData`** folder. The rest of the program will run without issues on **C++11**.

# Purpose:

The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate how basic C++ concepts can be effectively utilized to develop a fully functional quiz game. By exploring the codebase, learners can gain insights into how to structure and implement a project in C++, reinforcing their understanding of the language's core principles.
