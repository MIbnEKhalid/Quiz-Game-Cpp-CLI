# Requirement

While **99.99%** of the code works with **C++11**, there is one function that requires **C++17** to operate properly. Specifically, this function deals with creating directories using the **`<filesystem>`** library, which is only available in **C++17** and latter versions.

If you're using **C++11**, you can simply remove the code related to folder creation and manually create a folder named **`UserHistoryData`**. The rest of the program will function without issues on **C++11**.

# Project Description:

This quiz game serves as a comprehensive demonstration of fundamental C++ concepts applied in real-world software development. It showcases the utilization of concepts such as classes, arrays, functions, loops, conditionals, string manipulation, file handling, and more, to create an interactive quiz experience

# Purpose:

The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate how basic C++ concepts can be effectively utilized to develop a fully functional quiz game. By exploring the codebase, learners can gain insights into how to structure and implement a project in C++, reinforcing their understanding of the language's core principles.
